# Flappy Bird

- ML/AI Development
- Game Development
- NEAT & Pygame

Game Concept: Flappy Bird is a popular side-scrolling
game where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly
between columns of green pipes without hitting them.
Objective: Achieve the highest possible score by
passing through the gaps between pipes.

Al Integration: The game includes an Al component that
uses NEAT to train neural networks to play Flappy Bird.
Neural networks control the bird's jumping behavior
based on input parameters such as bird position and
pipe positions.
